                        </h3>
                        <p>
                                In my sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta, we have a points system. If you miss events without an excuse, you lose points. If you go to non-required events, you gain points.
                                To be in good standing and be able to go to fun events such as formal, you must be at 0 or positive points. Currently, members have no way of knowing their point values 
                                without reaching out to the VP of Administration, who keeps track of everyone's points. We also cannot just have an excel spreadsheet for everyone to 
                                view because points are supposed to be private. In order to fix this issue, I created the Theta Tracker. Each user is given a unique password, 
                                which they can use to login to this website and check their points. Additionally, I added a dues checker as well since I am VP of Finances and 
                                would like to consolidate all of this information into one program. There also is a feature for members to check when their points and dues were last updated. 
                        </p>
